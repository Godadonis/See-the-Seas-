# ðŸŒŠSee-the-SeasðŸŒŠ

***Description***: See the Seas is a website that allows users to build itineraries that accommodate their traveling preferencesâ€”allowing the user to fulfill their ideal itinerary full of exciting new adventures. During a vacation, planned activities can be stressful and overwhelming at times. Booking flights and hotel rooms, travel insurance, and finding things to do is often the last thing on many travelers' minds. The ideal vacation is without much stress once you arrive at the destination, but things do not go as planned frequently. With this new digital itinerary software, the travel agent or individual traveler can share a document or web itinerary with their client, family, and friends so that the website can notify the traveling party of the generated list of things to do.
